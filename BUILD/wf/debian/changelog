waterfox (53.0) xenial; urgency=high

    * Removed all patches (patches are only on KDE Edition now)
    * Moved waterfox folder from usr/lib/waterfox to opt/waterfox
    * Disabled automatic updates, because we have updates through repo, so this not needed (updates aren't disabled for extensions)
    * Updated to Firefox 53.0
    * NPAPI Plugins and unsigned extensions should still run
