waterfox-kde (53.0) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed error on startup
  * Added firefox-branded-icons.patch and fix-wifi-scanner.diff
  * Moved waterfox folder from usr/lib/waterfox to opt/waterfox
  * Moved kwaterfoxhelper to separate package
  * Disabled automatic updates, because we have updates through repo, so this not needed (updates aren't disabled for extensions)
  * Updated to Firefox 53.0
  * NPAPI Plugins and unsigned extensions should still run
