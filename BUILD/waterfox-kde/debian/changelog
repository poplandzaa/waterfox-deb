waterfox-kde (53.0.1) xenial; urgency=high

    * Use built in OS location services. This will require permissions from your OS, which should ask when Waterfox tries to utilise the API
    * Fixed add-on corruption issue on add-ons with no manifest ID
    * Fixed a crash when KFileDialog is opened in Waterfox and then cancelled (probably boo#1015998)
